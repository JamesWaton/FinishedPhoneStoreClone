Dear who wishes to read my code,
I have created this project as a way to better understand how PHP and MySQL
 works after taking the PHP free code academy course online.
This project has not only improved my skills in PHP and MySQL
but has taught myself how to use php storm as a code editor although
when i'm not coding in PHP i still prefer using visual studio code.
Through the week and a half of creating this I have also been able to
learn how to use owl carousel to filter through items, practice using sass
and Jquery as these areas have been marginally improved. Although a must thank
daily tuition complete mobile shopee e-commerce website course - PHP & MySQL.
I have followed through the video to teach me how all of these technologies work
and how to apply them. Although I have copied his photos and MySQL database
to make the project quicker. As you may find by seeing set prices and a set star rating
as they are set to the single product type. Going back to how i prefer to use visual studio
code you can see where i first started making the project in visual studio code in the HTML Template
folder. Then when i started using php i copied and pasted it all into new php folders as that was
the idea to start using PHP while also learning the best code editor to use for editing PHP.
Also when creating this project i came into a few problems with connecting the JavaScript folder
. So i would have to create a new one to go around this problem then connect the new folder instead.
the same problem occurred with making style.css.
